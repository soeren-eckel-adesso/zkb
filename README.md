## About this Demo

In this demo you will find a fully configured basic webstore using Vendr on Umbraco v10. The store is based around a fictitious tea retailer called Blendid which lists a variety of teas from multiple companies and also displays them in categories. Where products have multiple pricing options, variant nodes are used to provide buying options for those particular product choices.

The site also showcases a basic shopping cart setup with cart management features via the Vendr API as well as a checkout flow following all the main steps required for a Vendr order entity. On checkout, there will also be examples of order confirmation emails that will be sent (**TIP** Use something like [Papercut](https://github.com/ChangemakerStudios/Papercut) to capture these without them needing to be actually sent).

In the back office you'll find a suggested content structure for a working Vendr webstore and you'll also be able to browse the store setup and example orders in the settings and commerce sections respectively.
